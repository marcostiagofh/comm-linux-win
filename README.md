# comm-linux-win
comm is the command used to compare two sorted files line-by-line

Here we have a Bash script for using comm to compare two files, say f1.txt and f2.txt, and write 3 output files:
- lines present only in f1
- lines present only in f2
- lines present both in f1 and f2

We also made a Python script for it to work in windows env.
